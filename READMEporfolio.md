# Porforlio-HW


## Description
I contructed a skeletal HTML and I started adding different elements inside, like img, nav, div, classs, paragraph, aside. So i can easily target them when im making my CSS.styling. I made the images certain size that can match the width and height of the section, i also added HTML styling by using <aisde> tags to create extra set sentences and even color. I created a nav bar that directs you to a certain cection on my page. On paragraph 2 I listed my Refractor HW. I also created a contact section with example links.
